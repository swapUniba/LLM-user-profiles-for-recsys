{"plain": "Based on the user's favourite books, it can be inferred that they enjoy reading fantasy, classics, and coming-of-age stories. They likely prefer a well-crafted plot with complex characters, a richly described setting, and a writing style that is both lyrical and engaging. They may enjoy longer books that offer a deep dive into the world and characters, with a focus on themes of love, loss, and self-discovery. The narrative structure could be a mix of first-person and third-person perspectives, with a slow and immersive pacing that allows the reader to fully absorb the story. Some likely themes include the power of imagination, the importance of family and community, and the search for meaning in life."}
