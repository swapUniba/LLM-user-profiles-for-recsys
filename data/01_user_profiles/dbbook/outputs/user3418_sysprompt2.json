{"plain": "Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction are both novels by J.D. Salinger. They are considered to be classics of American literature and are known for their unique style, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes. The novels are set in the 1950s and explore the lives of young adults coming of age in a complex and often confusing world. The writing style is characterized by Salinger's use of stream-of-consciousness narration, which allows the reader to experience the characters' inner thoughts and feelings in a highly intimate and introspective way. The novels are considered to be masterpieces of modernist literature and have been widely praised for their innovative approach to storytelling and their ability to capture the essence of the human experience.", "raise high the roof beam, carpenters and seymour": ["an introduction are both novels by j"]}
