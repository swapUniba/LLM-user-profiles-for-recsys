They likely prefer complex plots with multiple layers and characters, as well as a strong sense of setting and atmosphere. Their favourite writing style may be more descriptive and immersive, rather than straightforward and plot-driven. They also seem to enjoy longer books, as opposed to shorter ones, and may prefer slower pacing that allows for more character development and world-building. The narrative structure may be more traditional, with a clear beginning, middle, and end, and themes that explore relationships, family, and identity."}
