Insert dataset audio files here. Suggestion: name each audio file with the id of the item used in the dataset. 
In our setting, we used the audio from the movie trailer, so they are the same files of '4_video'

Due to copyright, we cannot provide the raw files, but you can use our embeddings
They can be downloaded here: https://mega.nz/file/ChdSVKjb#vH3c1_T2RfVyCqBOVPajmKs8j6OZmMChV5USjHVw7IA

We will weekly check the link works, and fix it in case of issues.
Thank you!
